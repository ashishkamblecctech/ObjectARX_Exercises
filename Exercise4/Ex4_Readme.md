## Following are steps for completion of assignment:
The main purpose behind this function is to add a line in software by using addLine function, within an AutoCAD application in ObjectARX environment.

For that we need to perform the following steps:
1) Release the current drawing's database by obtaining a pointer to it.
2) Allows read-only access to the Block Table, which holds information about blocks in the drawing.
3) Release the Block Table Record for the Model Space, a special block where drawing entities are typically placed.
4) Specifies the 3D coordinates for the start and end points of the new line.
5) Allocates memory for a new AcDbLine object, representing a straight line entity in AutoCAD.
6) It will add a new line in the space and shows us on the screen.
7) Closes the Model Space Block Table Record, ensuring proper resource handling.
8) Releases resources associated with the new line object, an essential step in memory management.

After following proper procedure we can see the line on the screen in AutoCAD software with specific dimemsions given in code.
