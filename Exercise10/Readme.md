The application defines a custom command, "MYCOMMAND," which prints the message "Hello in the World of AutoCAD" to the AutoCAD command line.

Steps:

2) Load the compiled ObjectARX file into AutoCAD using the "APPLOAD" command in the AutoCAD command line.
3) Unload the custom command feature after use by clicking on the "Unload" command in the Appload window.
